                            Why should a private doctor cost a fortune? Most of our patients have never used private healthcare before in their lives. DocTap have 15 minute private GP appointments from just Â£49. There are no additional charges for writing prescriptions, sick notes or referral letters during the appointment. After your doctor's appointment you are sent detailed consultation notes which you may share with your NHS GP if you choose.

                            As a private GP practice you do not need to be registered with an NHS GP to use our doctors surgery. New patients are most welcome. If you are a tourist or foreign visitor you can book an appointment with a doctor now. No extra paperwork or registration is required. DocTap is regulated by the Care Quality Commission.
